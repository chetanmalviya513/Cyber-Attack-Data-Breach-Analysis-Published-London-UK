## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of cyber attack and data breach incidents. The data was largely unstructured, which I effectively organized and cleaned using advanced Excel functions and filters.

During this time, I collaborated with Dr. Saligram Prajapat on data analysis and visualization to provide strong analytical support for his research. I created insightful and attractive dashboards in Tableau that clearly show the trends and patterns of cyber attacks
